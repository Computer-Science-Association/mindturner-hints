### Hints:

#### Stage 1:

Q1. There are only two letters which matter in the equation. The RHS of equation need to be looked at as inverses (1/25 -> 25) to calculate the values. Final answer will be of the form 1/x. (The string 1/x, x being replaced by some number, is the expected answer. Don't try decimal numbers).

Q2. Check out the given engines on google maybe? (A popular software - two words in the name - is expected. One space between the two words and all letters capital).

Q3. Some linux trivia... (A two lettered single word expected, all caps).
