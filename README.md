## Mindturner Hints

We will be publishing hints here every few hours to help people who are stuck. The hints will be declared on the basis of how people are performing. 

Head out in the bottom of the site to check for any updates/discrepancy reporting.

### Hints:

#### Stage 1:

Q1. There are only two letters which matter in the equation. The RHS of equation need to be looked at as inverses (1/25 -> 25) to calculate the values. Final answer will be of the form 1/x. (The string 1/x, x being replaced by some number, is the expected answer. Don't try decimal numbers).

Q2. Check out the given engines on google maybe? (A popular software - two words in the name - is expected. One space between the two words and all letters capital).

Q3. Some linux trivia... (A two lettered single word expected, all caps).

#### Stage 2:

Q1. Use Shazam's real name as it appears in DC Comics. Two worded in the format: Firstname Lastname (first letter capital).

Q2. Hint: Number systems. Hint 2: Squidward is an **octopus**.

Q3. Morse is an encoding and so is ROT-13.

#### Stage 3:

Q1. You get 3 weights of each value you purchase. You can thus utilize the values in several different ways (example keeping one weight on one side and 2 weights on the other side of the balance. Try to use this to find which weights you can buy and what permutation can be used.

Q2. Note that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, a-b) = gcd (a, a+b) and so on... Thus all destinations they should visit have the same gcd. 

#### Stage 4:

Q1. Straight permutations and combinations questions. There's no twist here.

#### Stage 5: 

Q1. Heard of a Spectrometer?

#### Stage 6:

Q1. What do we do if a python package isn't on our local machine? That's right - pip install mindturner!
